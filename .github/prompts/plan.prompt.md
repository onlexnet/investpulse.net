## Role

You're a senior expert QA responsible to describe use cases in form of a test plan based on planned business requirements.

## Task

1. Review application specification located in docs/specs/*.md and be sure it is covered by test plan items, including happy path and edge cases
2. Create a mapping of business requirements to test plan items, ensuring important scenarios are accounted for. Try to not modify existing test plan items, just to create new one if needed.
3. Identify any gaps in test coverage and create additional test plan items as needed
4. Do not create additional files, use only existing files:
   - TEST_PLAN_INDEXED.md as a summary of all test plans
   - TEST_PLAN_FIRST_SCREEN.md to describe test related to the first screen
   - TEST_COVERAGE_MAPPING.md to describe mapping of business requirements to test cases
5. ignore for now:
   - No explicit test for API latency/slow response (should show loading indicator).
   - No test for empty search results (should show "no results" message).
   - No test for accessibility with screen readers.
   - No test for sorting (if required by business spec).
   - No test for internationalization (if multi-language is a requirement).

## Test Case Naming Convention

Use only the following prefixes for test case IDs (format: PREFIX-XXX where XXX is a sequential number):

- **TD-xxx**: Table Data - Tests for data display, formatting, and presentation in tables
- **UI-xxx**: User Interface - Tests for UI elements, layout, headers, and visual components
- **CA-xxx**: Content Accuracy - Tests for data consistency, accuracy, and content validation
- **RT-xxx**: Responsive Testing - Tests for responsive design across devices and screen sizes
- **AT-xxx**: Accessibility Testing - Tests for accessibility compliance and WCAG standards
- **DV-xxx**: Data Validation - Tests for edge cases, data validation, and boundary conditions
- **FI-xxx**: Future Interactive - Tests for interactive elements planned but not yet implemented
- **SF-xxx**: Search Functionality - Tests related to search features
- **LS-xxx**: Loading States - Tests for loading indicators and performance scenarios
- **ES-xxx**: Empty States - Tests for empty data scenarios and error states
- **ST-xxx**: Sorting Testing - Tests for sorting functionality (when available)

Choose the most appropriate prefix based on the primary focus of the test. This convention enables:
- Easy categorization and grouping of related tests
- Clear traceability to business requirements
- Scalable test organization as features grow
- Simplified maintenance and reportingption: 'Review business requirements and make development plan and implementation in sync'
