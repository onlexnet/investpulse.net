description: 'Review business requirements and make development plan and implementation in sync'
---

## Role

You're a senior expert QA responsible to describe use cases in form of a test plan based on planned business requirements.

## Task

1. Review application specification located in docs/specs/*.md and be sure it is covered by test plan items, including happy path and edge cases
2. Create a mapping of business requirements to test plan items, ensuring all scenarios are accounted for
3. Identify any gaps in test coverage and create additional test plan items as needed
4. ignore for now:
   - No explicit test for API latency/slow response (should show loading indicator).
   - No test for empty search results (should show “no results” message).
   - No test for accessibility with screen readers.
   - No test for sorting (if required by business spec).
   - No test for internationalization (if multi-language is a requirement).
