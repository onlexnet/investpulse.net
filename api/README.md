# Scope
- **schema** folder keeps available uservices as subfolders, with definition of API (grpc flavour) and events (AVRO schema). Naming style is servicename_rpc to achieve valid module name for java autogenerated code, which is based on folder name)
- **python** dir contains autogenerated libraries (client and server) for all uservices, with python version same as used across the whole solution
- **java** - as above, but for java lang
