# Test Plan Index

This file contains links to detailed test plans for individual screens and functionalities of the application.

## Test Plans Overview

- [Main Screen (Stocks/ETF Ranking)](./TEST_PLAN_FIRST_SCREEN.md) - Comprehensive test plan for the main application screen
- [Test Coverage Mapping](./TEST_COVERAGE_MAPPING.md) - Business requirements to test case mapping and gap analysis

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Test Documentation Structure
- **TEST_PLAN_FIRST_SCREEN.md** – Main screen functionality tests
- **TEST_COVERAGE_MAPPING.md** – Requirements coverage analysis and gap identification
- **test_plan_etf_details.md** – ETF detail screen tests (future)
- **test_plan_login.md** – User authentication tests (future)
- **test_plan_search.md** – Search functionality tests (future)

### Test Categories Covered

#### Functional Testing
- Data display and presentation
- Visual indicators and color coding
- User interface interactions
- Data validation and formatting

#### Non-Functional Testing
- Responsiveness across devices
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG AA)
- Performance and loading states
- Error handling and edge cases

#### Automation Strategy
- Unit tests for components and utilities
- Integration tests for API interactions
- End-to-end tests for user journeys
- Visual regression tests for UI consistency

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
- Review relevant test plans before implementing features
- Ensure all test scenarios are considered during development
- Use test plans to validate implementation completeness

### For QA Engineers
- Use test plans as the foundation for manual testing
- Reference coverage mapping to identify testing gaps
- Update test plans as new features are added

### For Product Managers
- Use coverage mapping to verify all business requirements are tested
- Review test priorities to align with business goals
- Ensure test plans reflect current product specifications

## Test Plan Maintenance

### Regular Reviews
- Monthly review of test plan accuracy
- Quarterly assessment of coverage completeness
- Update test priorities based on feature importance

### Version Control
- Track changes to test plans alongside code changes
- Maintain test plan versioning aligned with product releases
- Document rationale for test plan modifications

### Continuous Improvement
- Monitor test effectiveness through defect analysis
- Enhance automation coverage incrementally
- Adapt test strategies based on technology changes
